              <h3>Is this only for mothers?</h3>
              <p>Our content is designed through the lens of mothers &mdash; the people most affected by the invisible load. But fathers and all parents benefit from the same tools and techniques. Many companies open it to all parents.</p>
            </div>

              <h3>Do participants need to be tech-savvy?</h3>
              <p>Not at all. We designed this for people who have never used AI tools before. If they can use email and a web browser, they can do this. We walk through every single step.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="faq-item">
              <h3>Can sessions be virtual?</h3>

            </div>
            <div className="faq-item">
              <h3>How does pricing work?</h3>
