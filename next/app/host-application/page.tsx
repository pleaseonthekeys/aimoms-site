            <h3>Do I need to know anything about AI?</h3>
            <p>Nope. The whole point is that you don&#8217;t. We teach beginners. If you&#8217;ve been curious but overwhelmed, you&#8217;re exactly who this is for.</p>

            <h3>What do I provide as the host?</h3>
            <p>Your home, the snacks, and the guest list. We send a simple hosting guide ahead of time. Wine and cheese are encouraged but not required.</p>

            <h3>How long is the evening?</h3>
            <p>About 3 hours total &#8212; including time to mingle before and after. The structured AI part is around 2.5 hours: an intro to AI, a hands-on session where you put AI to work on real mom-life to-dos, and a Q&amp;A.</p>
