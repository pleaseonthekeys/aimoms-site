# Working Memory — ai.moms™ (aimoms.ai)
*Started: 2026-06-22*

## Current Sprint
Working on: Migrating the static HTML site → Next.js + Supabase + Vercel.
  Full plan: ~/.claude/plans/aime-html-is-no-robust-fog.md
Status: Phase 0 DONE. Phase 1 LOCAL SCAFFOLD done (Next.js app in next/).
  Supabase + Vercel provisioning still deferred (do with Lauren at the dashboards).
Blocked by: Nothing (provisioning is a deliberate later step).
Next step: Provision Supabase (articles + submissions tables) + Vercel project WITH Lauren;
  then Phase 2 — port pages + shared layout into next/ (start with Header/Footer + homepage).
Repo layout: root = live static HTML (reference); next/ = the Next.js rebuild.

## What's been built
(Static site on Netlify, as of 2026-06-22 — the migration target)
Homepage, Foundations (sales/register/thank-you), Membership $59/mo, Workshop $68,
Experiences & Events (display-only), Shop, Quiz funnel, Subscribe/newsletter "The Edit",
43 articles (articles-data.js), Community/Science/Corporate/Curriculum/Press,
Careers + 6 intern pages, Privacy/Terms.

## Deployment
Last deploy: Live on Netlify (aimoms.ai) — pre-migration.
Live URL: https://aimoms.ai
Last commit: "docs: switch plan to Vercel + AI SDK; add Stripe/Forms migration requirements"
Deploy status: Live on Netlify; not yet on Vercel.

## Decisions made and why
- 2026-06-22: Source of truth = Raquel's canonical multi-product zip (newer than the old snapshot).
- 2026-06-22: Drop the on-site Aime chatbot (no longer live); no AI feature in the migrated site.
  ("Aime" the concept — the assistant a mom builds in the course — stays as brand language.)
- 2026-06-22: Course stays $247 for now (config/env value); its Stripe link + price will
  change within days when Raquel raises the price — keep both as one-edit config.
- 2026-06-22: Form notifications via Resend → hello@aimoms.ai; Lauren sets it up during
  migration, Raquel owns the account; API key in Vercel env. Newsletter list may move to
  ConvertKit/Kit later.
- 2026-06-22: about.html (intentional removal) and welcome.html (dup of index) dropped.
- 2026-06-22: Stripe success_url → on-site *-thank-you pages (Stripe doesn't host the
  confirmation; those pages are in the zip).
- 2026-06-22: Gated course area (aimomsfoundationscourse) = route placeholder only this
  migration (Supabase Auth later).
- 2026-06-22: Quiz = port as-is + TODO (keep/redesign/remove later).
- 2026-06-22: Re-host the 67 Unsplash images into /public. DNS registrar access available for cutover.

## Phase log
- 2026-06-22 — Phase 0 complete (commit c5d5b21): synced project to Raquel's canonical
  multi-product zip. Added 14 new pages (Foundations/Membership/Workshop sales+register+
  thank-you, Experiences, Events, host-application, host-success, out-of-office-waitlist);
  refreshed every existing page + sitemap.xml + raquel.png; deleted about/aime/on-demand/
  waitlist; dropped welcome.html (dup of index). articles-data.js unchanged (43 articles).
  Handbook commit beforehand: c5904da.
- 2026-06-22 — Phase 1 local scaffold (commit 876d0e5): create-next-app → Next 16
  (App Router) + TS + Tailwind 4 + ESLint in next/. Removed create-next-app's generic
  CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md (root handbook is authoritative). Supabase/Vercel NOT provisioned.

## Errors fixed — don't repeat these
